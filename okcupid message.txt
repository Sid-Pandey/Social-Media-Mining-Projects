Hey Sandy...great to meet you! :)

So let's cut to the chase .

1. I'm 6 ft. So you're guaranteed to get that tall jar on the cabinet...whenever you need it ;)

2. I'm currently in Grad school at ASU so I could give you tips :D

3. Making life difficult...I do it too..mostly procrastination and stuff...but yeah I tend to get myself back on track somehow!

4. I love singing...so we could totally do a duet sometime!

Other than that....I'm just a regular guy looking for a partner in crime to laugh with, travel with, hang out with and many other withs :P and also a weekend buddy who'd watch shows on Netflix with me...perhaps with a cup of coffee on the side table! Sound interesting? ;)

So yeah...hit me up whenever you're free...and I look forward to getting to know you!
